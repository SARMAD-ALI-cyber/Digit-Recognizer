# Digit-Recognizer
This is a Deep Learning project for self learning. In this project dataset is taken from kaggel site which contains images of digits from 0-9 and model is trained to predict the image.
The model uses Singel hidden layer and have relu and softmax activation functions.
It is built from scratch and dont use any package like Tensorflow all propagations and initializations are done by me.
As it is trained on one hidden layer it some times pridect wrong moreover it is open source and everyone is welcomed to make it more perfect by using
different Hyper-parameters.
Moreover this model and whole algo is my own work.
