# Digit-Recognizer
This is a Deep Learning project for self learning. In this project dataset is taken from kaggel site which contains .npy files which have  images of digits from 0-9 and model is trained to predict the image.
The model uses Singel hidden layer and have relu and softmax activation functions.
It is built from scratch and dont use any package like Tensorflow.
As it is trained on one hidden layer it some times pridect wrong image moreover it is open source and everyone is welcomed to make it more perfect by using
different Hyper-parameters.
**_Note!_**
This project was my first project to test my skills in deep learning it will become more better in future.

**_Back-Propagation:_**

The list of formulas to calculate gradient descent during Back-Propagatin are these:

It uses 30 neurons at hidden layer and number of iterations are 1200.
